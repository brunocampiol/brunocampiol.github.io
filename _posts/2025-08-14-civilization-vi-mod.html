<h1>Civilization VI Raze Cities (and capitals) mod</h1>
<br />
<p>
    Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
    Epic Games continues to impress. Recently, they offered Civilization VI Platinum Edition 
    for free. As one of my favorite turn-based games, I redeemed it immediately. This wasn’t 
    my first experience with the game—I’ve owned the standard version for quite some time 
    and remembered some mods I used to enjoy.
</p>
<p>
    Finding mods through Steam is easier thanks to the Workshop, which handles installation 
    automatically. Unfortunately, this feature isn’t available on Epic Games. While searching 
    for alternatives, I discovered the NexusMods website and found a mod that seemed to offer 
    what I was looking for (raising any city). However, the mod wasn’t working. I decided to 
    try modifying it myself, and after a few attempts, I got it working.

    If you’re interested, you can check it out on the 
    <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/civilisationvi/mods/238">NexusMods webpage</a> or in 
    this <a href="https://github.com/brunocampiol/civilization-vi-raze-capital">GitHub repository</a>.

    Below are some screenshots of the mod in action:
