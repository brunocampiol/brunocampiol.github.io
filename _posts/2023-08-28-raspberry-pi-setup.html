<h1>Raspberry Pi 2 revival</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    I've decided to give this piece of hardware a try. It's been a while since I last used it. One of the things came
    into my mind on giving it a second chance was to use it for some sort of self hosting device. Now, to help with
    electricity costs, I came with an idea to use the existing USB from my ISP modem. Luckily for me, that worked just
    fine.

<h2>Network</h2>
<p>
    You will need a domain name to host using these instructions.
</p>
<h2>OS</h2>
<p>
    I've installed the official Raspberry Pi OS Lite <a
        href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/</a>. There's no GUI support
    but will just just fine for what we want to.
</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
    Instead of opening the ports for my local hardware, I am using Cloudflare tunnels. They are king of reverse proxy.
    See more instructions on below links. In addition, you get a SSL connection. As per content serving, I am using Nginx.
