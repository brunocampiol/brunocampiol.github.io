<h1>Project Zomboid character backup automation</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Ever wanted to backup your character so you don't loose it? That's possible by backing up your game after you finish
  playing it. This page helps you automate it.</p>
<p>After exiting the game, run the script to create a 7z backup file of you character.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>7zip</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Usually your saves will be in C:\Users\MY_USER_IN_WINDOWS\Zomboid\Saves</p>
<p>Create a powershell script 'lumb2backup.ps1' with below content. This script will 7zip your save file.</p>
<p>Remember to change the following parts with your particular case</p>
<ul>
  <li>MY_USER_IN_WINDOWS - your actual user name where zomboid save files</li>
  <li>MY_SAVE_FILE_IN_PZ - your actual save name</li>
</ul>
<p>Have below code as your backup-script.ps1</p>
<pre>
  <code class="border">
# Project Zomboid user saves
$folderPath = "C:\Users\MY_USER_IN_WINDOWS\Zomboid\Saves\Sandbox\"

# Name of the save to backup
$folderName = "MY_SAVE_FILE_IN_PZ"

# Target backup path
$backupPath = $folderPath + $folderName

# Define the 7z file path
$7zFilePath = $backupPath + ".7z"

# Check if the 7z file already exists
if (Test-Path $7zFilePath) {
Write-Output "Deleting previous 7z file: $7zFilePath"
Remove-Item $7zFilePath
}

# Compress the folder and its contents into a 7z file
Write-Output "Creating 7z file from folder: $backupPath"
& "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" a -t7z $7zFilePath $backupPath\* -r

# Waits for user confirmation
Read-Host -Prompt "Press Enter to exit"
  </code>
</pre>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>After finish playing, run the script. It will create a .7z file having your character last play.</p>
<p>If you die, delete the existing content in your save folder and replace with the .7z content</p>
<script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>
