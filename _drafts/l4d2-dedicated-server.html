<h1>L4D2 2023 dedicated server tutorial</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    It's been a while since I last played and recently I was trying play versus but always high ping. Looks like there
    aren't many Brazilian servers anymore (vanilla versus). Next, I've decided to try to host my own. It took me some
    weeks to figure out everything, plus my limitations around linux management. Therefore, here's my own tutorial about
    hosting a L4D2 versus linux. It may sound funny but the linux setup it's not that hard.
</p>
<p>
    In short, this will help you how to setup a vanilla versus server (with extra mods to
    keep you server up).
</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ubuntu 20 Azure VM</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
    We'll cover each separately: VM and Software setup (SteamCMD, LinuxGSM and mods).
