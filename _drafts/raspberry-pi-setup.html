<h1>Raspberry Pi 2 model B self hosting</h1>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
    The goal was to give this hardware a retry as a (cheap) self hosting device.
</p>
<p>
    Hit: You can have it running virtually free by using your router usb port.
</p>
<p>
    It is required to have a DNS domain name.
</p>
<h2>
    Install OS
</h2>
<p>
    Just follow official steps: Install Raspberry Pi OS using Raspberry Pi Imager ->
    <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi OS</a>
</p>
<p>
    Remember the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#the-raspi-config-tool">raspi-config tool</a>. 
    It has some good options to change some settings in the raspberry pi board.
