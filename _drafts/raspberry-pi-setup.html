<h1>Raspberry Pi 2 revival</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    I've decided to give this piece of hardware a try. It's been a while since I last used it. One of the things came
    into my mind on giving it a second chance was to use it for some sort of self hosting device. Now, to help with
    electricity costs, I came with an idea to use the existing USB from my ISP modem. Luckily for me, that worked just
    fine.

<h2>Network</h2>
<p>
    You will need a domain name to host using these instructions. I bought one for $1 dollar.
</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<h3>OS</h3>
<p>
    I've installed the official Raspberry Pi OS Lite <a
        href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/</a>. There's no GUI support
    but will just just fine for what we want to.
</p>
<h3>Additional</h3>
<p>
    Following are the additional software required to host. To serve pure http content only Nginx is required.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Nginx
    </li>
    <li>
        .NET Core runtime
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Also make sure to follow these instructions
