<h1>Raspberry Pi 2 revival</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    I've decided to give this piece of hardware a try. It's been a while since I last used it. One of the things came
    into my mind on giving it a second chance was to use it for some sort of self hosting device. Now, to help with
    electricity costs, I came with an idea to use the existing USB from my ISP modem. Luckily for me, that worked just
    fine.
