      This website is intended to showcase some of the projects I've worked on. 
      Currently, the frontend is hosted as an open-source project on GitHub Pages, 
      while the backend is powered by a self-hosted .NET Core API that I developed 
      and run on my own dedicated hardware. In other words, everything you see here 
      is homemade and built using full-stack knowledge.

      But it wasn't always like this. Initially, the site was built using PHP, 
      as it was the only option available with free hostingâ€”I didn't have the hardware 
      or funds at the time to run my own server. Later, I moved it to .NET Core when 
      I had an Azure subscription that allowed me to host it there, but that eventually 
      ended as well. With more knowledge, better hardware, and GitHub Pages becoming 
      available, I decided to integrate GitHub Pages with my self-hosted .NET Core API.

      You can explore some of my content below. A few JavaScript projects have already 
      been ported from the legacy site, such as the <i>JS Pi Calculator</i> and 
      <i>Box2D JS</i>, which I recommend checking out in the <a href="./posts">Blog Posts</a> 
      section. You can also browse my 
      <a href="https://github.com/brunocampiol?tab=repositories">Github repositories</a> 
      for additional work.
